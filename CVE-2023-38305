Description:
An issue was discovered in Webmin 2.021. The download functionality allows an attacker to exploit a Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerability. By providing a crafted download path containing a malicious payload, an attacker can inject arbitrary code, which is then executed within the context of the victim's browser when the download link is accessed.
RISK FACTOR:  High
Affected Component â€“ URLs to download parameter.
Procedure for reproducing the issue:
1.	In this context, we possess a payload accessible at https://detectify-labs.s3.amazonaws.com/csp.html, which has been referenced in the blog located at https://labs.detectify.com/2015/05/28/building-an-xss-polyglot-through-swf-and-csp/.
2.	We integrate the aforementioned URL path into the section designated for downloading: "URL to Download."
3.	Once the download process concludes successfully for the specified files, proceed as follows:
4.	Return to the "Download from Server" section and insert the path obtained from the earlier successful message.
5.	Execute the download operation, leading to the manifestation of an XSS popup.
